# :wrench: ThreadCalc
*A .NET project for solving goemetric dimensions, tolerances, and specifications for mechanical threads.*
> Note: This project is in design stages. 

---------
## Overview
ThreadCalc provides a library of code to compute 
dimensions, tolerances, and other specifications for a variety of mechanical threads. 
Threads are an inherently complex feature of engineering and manufacturing. 
ThreadCalc aims to simplify the complexity of computing thread specifications
manually.

ThreadCalc is a great tool for those in the precision machining industry or mechanical engineering field. 

## Supported Thread Forms
The following threads are supported by ThreadCalc:

- Unified Thread Standard (UTS) *Does not support UNJ design profile*
- Metric Threads (M Profile)
- Buttress Thread (ANSI 45/7°)
- ... Others in future.

## Relevant Standards
Computations within this project reference relevant engineering standards for the forms supported. These include the following:
- [ASME B1.1-2019](https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/b1-1-unified-inch-screw-threads-un-unr-thread-form): Unified Inch Screw Threads (UN, UNR, and UNJ Thread Forms)
- [ASME B1.13M-2005](https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/b1-13m-metric-screw-threads-m-profile): Metric Screw Threads: M Profile
- [ISO 68-1:2023](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:68:-1:ed-2:v1:en): ISO general purpose screw threads
